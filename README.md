<!-- Change it for yourself: -->
A practical to-do-list in website, the features are as follows:
1. Use object to store the 'todo's.
2. Separating application logic from the DOM-related staff(an object called 'DOMStaff' maybe a good idea).
3. Use Factory function, Object Constructor or Class to generate the objects(with methods?).
4. Use the external library 'date-fns' to formatting dates and times.
5. Use 'localStorage' to store data.
6. Use JSON format to store data.
7. Use webpack to develop.
8. Set GitHub template and use it.
9. Use ES6 Modules to develop.
10. Practice SOLID principles.
11. Try add some animations.
